URLminder
==================

URLminder lets you connect to [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com) and set up a goal to beemind the number of words you publish at one or more publicly accessible URLs.

You can use this application as a basis for other Beeminder integrations, like Beeminding a Twitter feed, your blog's Atom feed, other structured data on the web, or anything else you can think of. 

If you publish/fork an integration, [tell us about it](https://www.beeminder.com/contact)! We'll collect them in some sort of central place so other Beeminders can discover them and use them. 

You can also get started on an integration easily by using the [OmniAuth strategy for Beeminder](https://github.com/beeminder/omniauth-beeminder).
